== Pre Work 

.AWS CLI, Serverless Framework and Ngrok
[%collapsible]
====

Install AWS CLI according to your operating system using this https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html[link].

If you don't have an IAM user follow *step A*, otherwise if you need to create only access keys for an existing user follow *step B*.

.A. Creating an IAM user and access keys 


*	Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/[IAM console].
*	In the navigation pane, choose *Users* and then choose *Add* user.
*	Type the user name for the new user, select *Programmatic access* and *AWS Management Console access* 
**	For *Console password*, choose *Autogenerated password*. You can view or download the passwords when you get to the Final page.
**	Select *Require password reset*.
**	Click *Next: Require password reset*.
*	Select *Attach existing policies directly*, choose *AdministratorAccess*,
*	Click *Next: Tags*, *Next: Review* and *Create User*.
*	To view the users' *access keys* (access key IDs and secret access keys), choose *Show* next to each password and access key that you want to see. To save the access keys, choose *Download .csv* and then save the file to a safe location.

.B. Creating access keys for an existing IAM user

*	Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/[IAM console].
*	In the navigation pane, choose *Users* and then choose the  existing user you want to create the access keys.
*	Under the *Security credentials* pane, in the section *Access keys* click *Create access key*
*	Type the user name for the new user, select *Programmatic access* and *AWS Management Console access* 
*	To view the users' *access keys* (access key IDs and secret access keys), choose *Show* next to *Secret access key*. To save the access key, choose *Download .csv* and then save the file to a safe location.

After installing AWS CLI and getting your access keys run this command to quickly set your AWS credentials, region and output format (default:json)
 
	$ aws configure


.Installing Node.js 

Serverless is a Node.js CLI tool so the first thing you need to do is to install Node.js on your machine.

Go to the official Node.js website, download and follow the installation instructions to install Node.js on your local machine.

Note: Serverless runs on Node v6 or higher.

You can verify that Node.js is installed successfully by running `node --version` in your terminal. You should see the corresponding Node version number printed out.

.Installing the Serverless Framework

Next, install the Serverless Framework via npm which was already installed when you installed Node.js.

Open up a terminal and type `npm install -g serverless` to install Serverless.

	$ npm install -g serverless

Once the installation process is done you can verify that Serverless is installed successfully by running the following command in your terminal:

	$ serverless

To see which version of serverless you have installed run:

	$ serverless --version

.Installing Ngrok

Ngrok is used to expose localhost endpoint in the internet. Install ngrok following the guide in https://ngrok.com[ngrok].

====


== Getting Started

=== Create SNS topic

	$ aws sns create-topic --name "orderCreated"


=== Create the lambda function, subscriber and the dead letter queue

	$ sls deploy

=== Run the java microservices 

Inside the folders `/microservices/order/` and `/microservices/stock/` run

	$ mvn spring-boot:run	


After installing ngrok, run:

	$ ./ngrok authtoken your_token

Expose the `localhost:8081/events/orderCreatedSubscriber` running

	$ ./ngrok http http://localhost:8081

Save the url provide from ngrok:

	http://XXXXXX.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8081  

Create a subscriber for the stock service

	$ aws sns subscribe \
  --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:YOUR_REGION:YOUR_ACCONT_ID:orderCreated  \
  --protocol http \
  --notification-endpoint http://XXXXX.ngrok.io/events/orderCreated/ \
  --attributes '{"RedrivePolicy":"{\"deadLetterTargetArn\":\"arn:aws:sqs:YOUR_REGION:YOUR_ACCONT_ID:OrdersDeadLetterQueue\"}"}'

== Testing

Fill the stock

	$ curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:8081/stock' \
	--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	--data-raw '{
			"sku": "123_aspirin",
			"amount": "100",
			"branchId": "1212"
		}'


	$ curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:8081/stock' \
	--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	--data-raw '{
			"sku": "456_ibuprofen",
			"amount": "200",
			"branchId": "1212"
		}'


Create and order

	$ curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/orders' \
	--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	--data-raw '{
			"orderId": "3333",
			"customerId": "11111",
			"walletId": "101010",
			"orderItems":[
				{
				"sku": "123_aspirin",
				"amount": "10",
				"branchId": "1212",
				"cost": "100"
				},{
				"sku": "456_ibuprofen",
				"amount": "10",
				"branchId": "1212",
				"cost": "50"
				}
			]
		}'


Check the CloudWatch log events of the lambda functions to see the printed order.

Check that the stock of ibuprofen is 190, since the order reserved 10 itens:

	$ curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8081/stock/456_ibuprofen'


=== Delete deployed serverless stack

	$ sls remove
